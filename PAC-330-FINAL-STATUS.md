## 🔧 Issues Fixed During Implementation

### Issue 1: Status Field Not Returned by API
**Problem:** API was missing status field in responses  
**Solution:** Added "status" to attributes array in getAllEmployees  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: All Users Showing as Deactivated
**Problem:** Database had NULL or '0' values for existing users  
**Solution:** Ran SQL update to set all users to status='1'  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 3: 500 Error on Toggle
**Problem:** Controller trying to access undefined `req.decodedToken`  
**Solution:** Changed to use `jwt_decode(req.header("accessToken"))`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 4: TypeScript Build Errors
**Problem:** Test files causing deployment build failures  
**Solution:** Excluded test files from tsconfig  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
